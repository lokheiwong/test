# SumpUp Take Home Test

## Q1 - Which are the main KPIs the mission lead should track to be able to answer his business question? How are you going to build these metrics? What are the different steps we shouldtrack? 

 * ROI of web orders and leads from marketing campaign
   * web orders: `sum(spend) / sum(NB_POSLITE_ITEMS_DISPATCHED)`
   * leads funnel: `sum(spend) / sum(TOTAL_POS_LITE_DEALS)`
 * Marketing Performence
   * CTR of web orders and leads from marketing campaign `sum(clicks) / sum(impressions)`
   * CPC of web orders and leads from marketing campaign `sum(spend) / sum(clicks)`
   * CPM of web orders and leads from marketing campaign `sum(spend) / sum(impressions)`
 * Funnels conversion rate - Each steps to an order of the product should be tracked in order to identify conversion rate in the steps, it helps to identify main bottle neck in the sales process, in web orders and leads funnels. 
  * web orders funnel
    * 1st funnel: `sum(NB_OF_POSLITE_ITEMS_ORDERED) / sum(NB_OF_ORDERS)` *100
    * 2nd funnel: `sum(NB_POSLITE_ITEMS_DISPATCHED) / sum(NB_OF_POSLITE_ITEMS_ORDERED)` *100
  * leads funnel
    * 1st funnel: `sum(TOTAL_FAKE_LEADS) / sum(TOTAL_LEADS)` *100
    * 2nd funnel: `sum(TOTAL_SQLS) / (sum(TOTAL_LEADS) - sum(TOTAL_FAKE_LEADS))` *100
    * 3rd funnel: `sum(TOTAL_MEETING_DONE) / sum(TOTAL_SQLS)` *100
    * 4th funnel: `sum(TOTAL_SIGNED_LEADS) / sum(TOTAL_MEETING_DONE)` *100
    * 5th funnel: `sum(TOTAL_POS_LITE_DEALS) / sum(TOTAL_SIGNED_LEADS)` *100


## In order to enable self-service analytics, the data team has to create data marts to enhance usage and to leverage data-driven insights. 

### Q2 - Create a staging tables for the provided source data. A staging table is a clean-up table following best SQL standards and conventions 
### Q3 - Based on these staging tables, create one or multiple tables to build a mart enabling dashboarding and self service. 

* Data Frame `channels`
```
CREATE TABLE `channels` (
  `CAMPAIGN_ID` text,
  `CAMPAIGN_NAME` text,
  `CAMPAIGN_PERIOD_BUDGET_CATEGORY` text,
  `CHANNEL_3` text,
  `CHANNEL_4` text,
  `CHANNEL_5` text
)
```
  * Remove blank space in `CAMPAIGN_NAME`, `CAMPAIGN_PERIOD_BUDGET_CATEGORY`, `CHANNEL_3`, `CHANNEL_4`, `CHANNEL_5`
  * Replace `unknown` in col `CAMPAIGN_PERIOD_BUDGET_CATEGORY`, if `CAMPAIGN_ID` has duplicates, and all other columns have the same value
  * Row Count: 120 (raw) vs 61 (after cleaning)
  * Distinct `CAMPAIGN_ID`: 61
  * ? Naming convention for campaign setup
```

### Q4 - Design a one-page dashboard that will help the Mission Lead to monitor the team performance based on the data model you designed above. Itâ€™d be best if you can build graphs from the existing data. But if you do not have time, then a drawing, assuming it is clear and readable, works too. Please take the time to explain your methodology and the choices you made. 

One-page dashboard
* Filters
  * Date Range
  * Marketing Campaigns
    * Sub-channels 3/4/5
  * Country Code
  * Product
* Scorce cards on top shows high level overview of marketing campaigns' performance and total number of POS lite orders. There could be a dognut charts/ small tables shows the % marketing and orders metrics by the 2 pathways (web order and leads) when hovering on the score cards
* The second part of the dashboard
  * Left side
    * Details of marketing campaigns performance of web order (top) and leads (bottom) in a table
      * Identify top marketing campaigns
      * Ideas: If a certain campaign is clciked, then the funnel analysis on the right would only show numbers of the selected campaigns
  * Right side
    * Details of sales funnels analysis of web order (top) and leads (bottom)
      * Funnel chart shows the numbers/ performance in each steps
      * Table shows % conversion rate between each steps
